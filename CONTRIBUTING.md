## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

To maintain clarity and consistency in the project’s history, we use [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Below are the rules for writing commit messages.

#### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

`<scope>` is optional

#### Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

### Branch Naming

#### Format

```
<type>/#<issueNumber>-<alias>
```

`issueNumber` is optional.

#### Example

```
feature/#1-init
^------^   ^---^
|          |
|          +---> issue's keyword
|
+-------> Type: or feat, chore, docs, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

- `feat` or `feature`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
